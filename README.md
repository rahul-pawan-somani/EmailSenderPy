# EmailSenderPy
This Python script allows you to send customized emails that can be formatted with the help of HTML. It can be particularly useful for sending newsletters, notifications, or any other kind of formatted email to your recipients. The script uses a Gmail account to send emails, but you can configure it to work with other email providers as well.
